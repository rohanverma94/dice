Dice
===

Dice ðŸŽ² is an extremely simple Golang-based in-memory KV store that speaks the Redis dialect.

## Why should you care?

Building a database from scratch has its own thrill, and you can leverage this to

- build a database from scratch
- learn database internals, starting with Redis
- learn about advanced data structures, algorithms, and event loops
- collaborate with other engineers and continute back to Open Source

## Setting up

To run DiceDB locally, you will need

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ go run main.go
```

## Dice in action

Because Dice speaks Redis' dialect, you can connect to it with any Redis Client and the simplest way it to use a [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/manual/cli/). Programmatically, depending on the language you prefer, you can use your favourite Redis library to connect.

## Getting Started

To get started with building and contributing to DiceDB, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) created in this repository.

## The story

DiceDB started as a re-implementation of Redis in Golang and the idea was to - build a DB from scratch and understand the micro-nuances that comes with its implementation. The database does not aim to replace Redis, instead it will fit in and optimize itself for multi-core computations running on a single-threaded event loop.
